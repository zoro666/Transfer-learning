# Transfer-learning
In this project, we modified and retrained an existing pre-trained CNN (vgg16) to detect airplanes in the images. 
This code requires tensorflow framework and an appropriate database on airplanes. We chose subset from caltech101 database.
Once you have the database, segregate into test,train,val for training and they have to be kept in the same folder as that of the code destination.
